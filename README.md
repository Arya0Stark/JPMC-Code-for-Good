## JPMC Code For Good Hackathon ##

The prestigious Code For Good Hackathon by JP Morgan Chase and Co is where the participants work alongside their technology experts in teams to solve real-world problems for nonprofits. I discovered what itâ€™s like to collaborate on new technology to come up with innovative solutions that meet the needs of nonprofit clients. In the process, we gain new skills, learn more about our firm and build your professional network while making a difference for an organization that needs your skills. 


My team, Illumi-techie, aimed to solve the problems with the website of the non-profit organisation- Jhatkaa. This repository contains the files of the detailed problem statement given by the NGO as well as the video explanation of our solution and final website addressing the problems, along with it's unique features.
The code for the login and signup pages is contained in the master zip file. The frontend and backend code are present in the corresponding zip files and routes and initial setup are present in the Routes zip file.

About our project:

The Front End is made by using html,jss,cs and the Back End is handled using Pandas and Django.

One of the key features that was laid out by the problem statement of Jhatkaa was citizen-campaigner interaction. 
The focus on this is understandable as engagement between a citizen and a volunteer can be a great influence for good. So our effort to implement this would be to host a community on the discussion forum of our website where volunteers can detail their experiences and the citizens can interact and clarify any doubts they might have regarding this.

There is also the implementation of the dashboard which is an essential objective for tracking and visualization. Here we have an activity page which aims to detail certain graphs of user engagement which is one of our  plans to be implemented later.

The backend uses Pandas to map the parameters into dataframes and a pie chart is created to visualize it for easy and comprehensive analysis.
